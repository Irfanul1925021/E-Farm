# E-Farm-SRS-Report
The traditional agricultural supply chain involves intermediaries such as brokers and syndicate
traders, who often take a significant share of the profits and leave farmers with a lower price for
their products. This can lead to unfair treatment of farmers and unsustainable practices in the
agriculture industry. Additionally, consumers are increasingly concerned about the quality and
source of their food, but may not have access to fresh, high-quality products due to limitations in
the traditional supply chain.
E Farm is a B2B aggregator platform that aims to address these challenges by providing a
marketplace for farmers to sell their products directly to consumers, cutting out intermediaries and
ensuring fair prices for farmers. E Farm also offers equipment rental and maintenance services to
make farming more cost-effective and efficient, as well as agro solution and consultancy services
to provide guidance on everything from plant protection to post-harvest management.
However, there may be challenges in creating a successful supply chain ecosystem that connects
farmers and consumers in a sustainable and efficient way. The purpose of this report is to assess
the effectiveness of E Farm's services and identify any potential challenges or areas for
improvement in the platform's business model.

Here is the complete software requirements specification report of our proposed project E-Farm.
